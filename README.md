# BASIC Computer Adventures

I have a book by David Ahl from the 80's which contained a few text adventure games, written in `BASIC`.  It looks like it is [available online at atariarchives](https://www.atariarchives.org/bca/). I remember typing in a couple of them and playing them back then, and thought it might be fun to re-create them in `python`.  This is a repository for that work.  

Since then, I've also been making web versions of them, as well, as a fun way to try recent javascript features like `async/await` and modules.

## Python

 - `bca.orient` is an Orient Express mystery to solve
 - `bca.neptune` is a voyage to neptune, where you must manage fuel

## TypeScript 

 - `orient.html` is the Orient Express mystery
 - `neptune.html` is the voyage to neptune.
